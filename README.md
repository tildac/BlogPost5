### 'The Middle East: Key Players and Notable Relationships', Information is Beautiful, David McCandless

This interactive data visualization was engineered by David McCandless, who is has presented a TedTalk on the value of visualizing data in closing information loopholes. For this work, he has created a visual map of the Middle East that links relationships of each country in the region to further connections. With each connection made in control by the viewer, the audience can learn more about the history, culture, and geographical links between each subject selected. I found this piece immediately striking. Not only are the visual ties beautiful in the simplicity of color and font, but the information itself is in-depth and allows for great understanding with the guidelines of "roll over," "click," and "click background," thereby aiding the viewer to navigate easily throughout the vast web of data provided.  


### 'Recording and Translating Climate Change,' Nathalie Miebach

Nathalie Miebach's work focuses on the fusion of art and science, via translating scientific data on astronomy, ecology, and meteorology into woven sculptures. She thus explores how artistic processes can be adopted to exemplify scientific data in graphs and diagrams while simultaneously probing consideration to what constitutes as a mixture of 'science' and 'art'. 

I was mostly fascinated by her project "Recording and Translating Climate Change," as she used weather observations from specific ecosystems to compare and contrast with historical and global meteorological trends. Having done this comparison, she visualized the data in the form of a sculpture. To further this, she has most recently been translating the data also into musical socres, which are also interpreted through sculptures and musical collaborations.
